# Enhancing-Revenue-through-Product-Analysis


**Project: Enhancing Revenue through Product Analysis**

In this project, I aimed to enhance the revenue of my company by analyzing product data and identifying opportunities for improvement. The project involved working with a diverse dataset containing information about products, their financials, reviews, and traffic data.

**Objectives:**

- Identify the correlation between discounts and revenue.
- Categorize products based on description and analyze their revenue.
- Investigate the relationship between revenue and customer reviews.

**Approach:**

I began by exploring the data and calculating correlations. I found a positive correlation of 0.65 between discounts and revenue, indicating that products with higher discounts tend to generate more revenue. This led to the insight that adjusting discount strategies could impact overall revenue.

Next, I created a CTE to filter footwear products based on specific keywords in their descriptions. I calculated the number of footwear products and the median revenue, discovering trends that would inform strategic decisions.

Finally, I examined the connection between customer reviews and revenue. I explored the strength and direction of the correlation between these two variables, providing insights into how product quality and customer satisfaction impact revenue.

**Results:**

Through the analysis, I found that adjusting discount strategies and focusing on footwear products could potentially boost revenue. By offering strategic discounts on certain high-revenue products and optimizing the product lineup, we can aim for improved revenue performance.

**Lessons Learned:**

This project taught me the importance of data-driven decision-making. By extracting meaningful insights from the data, I gained valuable insights into customer behavior and product performance. Additionally, I enhanced my SQL skills, particularly in using functions to calculate metrics and correlations.

Overall, this project has paved the way for informed business strategies that can help our company increase revenue while providing a better understanding of customer preferences and behavior.
